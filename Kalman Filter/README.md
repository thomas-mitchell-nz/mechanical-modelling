Sensor Fusion
================================

`calibration.csv` -- use this to determine the sensor models.

`training1.csv`, `training2.csv` -- use these to determine the motion models.

`test.csv` -- use this dataset with your Bayes filter to estimate the robot's location (note this does not contain the ground truth).

`plot-calibration.py` -- this plots the sensor data.
	
`plot-speeds.py` -- this plots the commanded robot speed and the estimated robot speed.  It is useful for pondering the motion model.
